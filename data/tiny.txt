The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. 
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
All that glitters is not gold.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
Time heals all wounds.
Actions speak louder than words.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Better late than never.
Practice makes perfect.
Knowledge is power.
Fortune favors the bold.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
The early bird catches the worm.
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
All roads lead to Rome.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
